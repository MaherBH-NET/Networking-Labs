# Routing Fundamentals Lab

## 🧭 Overview
This lab focuses on understanding and implementing routing fundamentals using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It covers static routing, route summarization, and default routes, providing the foundation for dynamic routing concepts.

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Cisco IOS CLI  

---

## 🧩 Key Topics
- Connected and Local Routes  
- Static Routes  
- Summary Routes  
- Default Routes (`0.0.0.0/0`)  
- Longest Prefix Match  
- Load Balancing with Equal-Cost Paths  

---

## 🧠 Skills Practiced
- Configuring static and default routes between multiple routers  
- Summarizing routes to optimize routing tables  
- Using `ping` and `traceroute` to verify network connectivity  
- Analyzing routing tables and path selection behavior  
- Implementing equal-cost load balancing  


---

## 🚀 Outcome
Successfully configured static and default routes to establish full connectivity between all subnets.  
Understood route summarization and longest prefix match behavior, forming a solid base for future OSPF and EIGRP configurations.
