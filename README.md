# Networking Projects by Maher Bou Hamdan

This repository contains my hands-on networking labs and projects built during my CCNA studies and personal practice.  
Each project demonstrates key networking concepts such as device configuration, routing, VLANs, troubleshooting, and network management using Cisco Packet Tracer.

I created/worked on these labs to strengthen my understanding of network design, configuration, and problem-solving â€” all skills that are essential for a future NOC or Network Engineer role.
