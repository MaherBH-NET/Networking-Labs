# Udemy Lab: Dynamic Routing Protocols

## 🧭 Overview
This lab focuses on configuring and verifying **dynamic routing protocols** to enable automated route exchange between routers. It demonstrates how routers dynamically discover networks and adjust to changes without manual static route configuration.

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco IOS CLI

---

## 🧩 Key Topics
- Dynamic routing vs. static routing
- Router discovery and neighbor relationships
- Route learning and advertisement
- Protocol metrics and best path selection

---

## 🧠 Skills Practiced
- Understanding dynamic routing concepts
- Configuring routing protocols using Cisco CLI
- Verifying routing behavior using `show` commands
- Testing automatic path selection and failure recovery

---

## 🧪 Verification Commands
- `show ip route`
- `show ip protocols`
- `show ip interface brief`
- `ping` / `traceroute` (for connectivity testing)

---

## 🚀 Outcome
Successfully configured a network using **dynamic routing**, enabling automatic route propagation between participating routers. This lab builds on your static routing knowledge and prepares you for advanced protocols like **OSPF and EIGRP**.
