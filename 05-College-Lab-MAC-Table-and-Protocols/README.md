# College Lab: Switch MAC Address Table and Protocols

## üß≠ Overview
This lab explores how switches manage traffic using MAC address tables and implements multiple Layer 2 protocols including VTP, STP, and LACP.  
The objective is to understand how VLANs are propagated, how loops are prevented, and how link aggregation enhances redundancy and bandwidth.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Cisco IOS CLI  

---

## üß© Key Topics
- VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)  
- Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)  
- Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)  
- Switch MAC address table behavior  

---

## üß† Skills Practiced
- Configuring VTP servers and clients  
- Analyzing STP topology changes and root bridge election  
- Setting up EtherChannel (LACP) links between switches  
- Observing MAC address learning and clearing tables  

---

## üöÄ Outcome
Built and tested a multi-switch topology with VLAN distribution, STP redundancy, and EtherChannel configuration.  
Learned how Layer 2 protocols optimize performance and reliability in switched networks.
